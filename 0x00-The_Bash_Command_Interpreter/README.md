The shebang, "#!/bin/bash" when used in scripts is used to instruct the operating system to use bash as a command interpreter. Each of the systems has its own shells which the system will use to execute its own system scripts. This system shell can vary from OS to OS.

Essentially it tells your terminal that when you run the script it should use bash to execute it. It can be vital since you may be using a different shell in your machine ( zsh , fish , sh , etc.), but you designed the script to work specifically with bash.

"Zsh" - Z shell...
"fish" - (The Fish is a Unix shell with a focus on interactivity and usability, designed to give the user features by default, rather than by configuration. Fish is considered an exotic shell since it does not rigorously adhere to POSIX shell standards, at the discretion of the maintainers)
"sh" - Shell...
